Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is among the most promising markets in blockchain  technology. The demand for financial services on decentralized technology is high. The  optimistic expectations for the potential of this technology has been evident in the  appreciating valuations of tokens native to DeFi protocols.  Since the start of 2020, the value locked into DeFi has risen roughly 400%. After two  years of conservative risk-taking, crypto investors have demonstrated that they’re willing  to allocate capital to the most exciting use case of blockchain technology. Billions of  people and institutions suffer from restricted or nonexistent access to financial services.  But blockchain has extended beyond simply “banking the unbanked”. Innovators are  developing protocols on the Ethereum network that allow users to loan, borrow, and  easily transfer and trade value.
